## Preparation
1. Prepare the dry rub.
   1. In a bowl, whisk together ingredients for the dry rub. Start with sugar and add other spices in a little at a time, tasting frequently, until you reach the desired flavour profile.
1. Prepare pork.
   1. If not already, cut the pork shoulder into ~1 lb long thin rectangular chunks.
   1. Lay out paper towel on a large flat plate. Lay the pork shoulder onto the paper towels and pat dry.
   1. Coat the pork with the dry rub, rubbing it into the meat well and coating evenly.
   1. Lay the pork on an aluminum foil covered baking sheet and place in fridge uncovered overnight.
1. Sear the pork.
   1. Add a few tbsp oil to the InstaPot and set to sautee setting.
   1. Lay the pork in the heated pot, sear all chunks on all 4 sides until browned a little.
   1. Remove the pork from the pot.
1. Prepare broth.
   1. While pot is still hot, toss in the onions, shallots, and garlic to sautee briefly.
   1. Deglaze the fond from the pork by pouring in water and vinegar.
   1. Whisk the tomato paste, brown sugar, liquid smoke, and red pepper flakes (optional) into the broth.
1. Cook pork.
   1. Add the pork back into the broth.
   1. Cover InstaPot, and set to pressure cook on high for 1 hour (add 10 additional minutes if pork is bone-in).
   1. Once done, quick release steam and pull out the pork into a large bowl.
1. Prepare sauce.
   1. Turn InstaPot on sautee setting to simmer the leftover broth so that it reduces by ~half (should take about 15 minutes). Add salt to taste.
   1. To help thicken, create a slurry with the cornstarch and water and add it to the mix while it is boiling.
   1. While sauce is reducing, shred pork with 2 forks.
   1. Add some of the sauce (to taste) to the shredded pork.

Serve with BBQ sauce on buttered and lightly toasted buns.
