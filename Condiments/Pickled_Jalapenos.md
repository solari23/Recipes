# Pickled Jalapeños

## Ingredients
* ~12 jalapeños
* 1/2 red onion
* 2 1/2 cups water
* 2 1/2 cups white vinegar
* 4 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 large airtight jar (~1.8L)

## Preparation
1. Chop the red onion into slivers, chop jalapeños into ~1/2 cm rings. 
1. Pack the jar with alternating layers of jalapeños and onion slivers.
1. Make brine: In a pot heat the water, vinegar, sugar, and salt until lightly simmering. Stir to dissolve salt and sugar.
1. Pour hot brine into jar until jalapeños are fully covered. Discard any leftover brine (there shouldn't be much).
1. Seal the jar and wait until cooled to room temperature. Move to fridge.
