# Hummus

This recipe uses a high-powered blender, but should also work in a food processor

## Ingredients
* 1 15oz can chickpeas, drained (but save the liquid)
* 1/4 cup lemon juice (~1 large lemon)
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/3 cup tahini, well mixed
* 1 large clove garlic, roughly crushed/chopped
* 3 tbsp aquafaba (chickpea can liquid)
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp salt

## Preparation
1. Put the lemon juice, tahini, and aquafaba in the blender jar. Mix together on slow setting until a smooth consistency is reached, stopping frequently to scrape down the sides of the jar.
1. Set blender to slow and slowly drizzle in olive oil into the mixture.
1. Add garlic and spices (cumin, coriander, salt) to the mixture, run blender on slow to mix.
1. Add chickpeas and blend, speeding up slowly to try to puree as much as possible to a smooth consistency.

## Notes
* Pinching the skin off the chickpeas can lead to a smoother texture, but isn't really necessary. It will still be very smooth without.
* You get best flavor if using cumin and coriander seeds. Toast them a little on a pan, and grind them using a coffee/spice grinder. Adding a pinch of cinnamon in the grinder adds even more depth.
